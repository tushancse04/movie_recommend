# Movie-Recommendation-System
As part of my Data Mining course project in Spring 17 at UMass; I have implemented a recommender system that suggests movies to any user based on user ratings. The dataset used is MovieLens 100k dataset. The items(movies) are correlated to each other based on user ratings given to them by users in system.

Recommender System using Item-based Collaborative Filtering Method using Python. Used “Pandas” python library to load MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users who liked similar movies using item-item similarity score.

Machine learning python libraries are required to run this program.

Repository contains 2 implementations. First file is a .py file and another is an IPython Notebook. The IPython notebook implementation gives step-by-step output of the application.

The dataset used is by GroupLens Research that has collected and made available rating data sets from
the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time,
depending on the size of the set.

In this experiment we have used the MovieLens 100K Dataset. It is available at the website linked here:
